The LP theory, as it stands, does not make concrete predictions about whether people prefer to block or interleave their learning. Naive implementation of LP algorithms (e.g., Colas et al., 2019) predict interleaving rather than learning.

However, if the learning curves or their derivatives are not known, the agent would have to infer its learning rate from noisy data. To overcome observational noise, the agent needs enough evidence, which makes a blocking strategy more appropriate. Perhaps, people block because they are not only trying to maximize LP, but also collecting evidence to make accurate judgments about LP.
