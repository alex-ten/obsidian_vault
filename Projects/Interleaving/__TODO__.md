## Clean up
- [ ] Is there a way to remove duplicates rows?
	- For some reason, some participants have repeated trials.
Hmm, perhaps just remove duplicates and treat them as missing values

- [ ] Look at confidence and accuracy right before/after switch
	- [ ] Compare switch from & switch to
- [ ] Come up with the clustering index (for the free condition)
- [ ] Check the [test-retest reliability](https://chfasoa.uni.edu/reliabilityandvalidity.htm#:~:text=Test%2Dretest%20reliability%20is%20a,test%20for%20stability%20over%20time.) for test 1 and 2.
- [ ] See if people who improved on test 2 relative to test 1 have improved with certain types of monsters.
