**Two ways** to measure working memory, conceptualized based on the discrete slots model.

For single-probe version of the [[Change-detection task|change-detection task]]:
$$
k_p = N \frac{HR-FA}{1-FA} \tag{1}
$$
and for whole-display version of the task:
$$
k_c = N(HR - FA) \tag{2}
$$
These are based on the [[Discrete-slots model of working memory|discrete-slots model of WM]]. It is assumed that holding an item in WM (i.e., storing in one of the slots) is sufficient  to correctly respond to a probe in a change-detection task. This is the so-called *threshold assumption* (p. 326).

The authors acknowledge alternative models of WM (e.g. the [[Equal-resources model of working memory|equal-resources model of WM]]), but argue that WM measurement based on the discrete-slots model is more interpretable:

> ... capacity is conceptualized as a limit in the number of slots, which is a highly interpretable quantity that may be compared across different conditions and groups. In limited-resources models, in contrast, there is no single natural capacity measure. For example, in Bays and Husainâ€™s power law theory of resource distribution, capacity consists of two parameters that describe how resources are allocated. These two parameters are domain specific, and patterns of variations across domains are not as interpretable as a number-of-slots measure. (p. 326)

## Zhao et al. (2022)
Argue that change-localization rather than [[Change-detection task|change-detection]] provides a more reliable test of visual working memory.

> ... we observed a strong correlation between change localization and change detection scores, suggesting that change localization taps into the same capacity construct. Second, we used a downsampling approach to determine the number of trials and subjects needed to achieve high reliability (Xu et al., 2018). This analysis revealed a substantial advantage in reliability for change localization compared to change detection, such that only half as many trials of change localization were required to achieve the same reliability scores. Finally, change localization required far fewer trials to detect known empirical patterns from the change detection literature, suggesting that this new task may provide a more efficient approach for a wide range of questions.
