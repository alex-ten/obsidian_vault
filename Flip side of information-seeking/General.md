We investigate the process of information-seeking (I-S) more closely. Historically, I-S studies have tended to induce situations which solicit instrumental or non-instrumental information-seeking decisions and behaviors.

1. Instrumental vs non-instrumental
2. Motivation for information-seeking
3. How does uncertainty tie into this?
4. Outcomes of information-seeking
	1. Reduction of uncertainty
	2. Increases of uncertainty
		1. Violation of beliefs
		2. Knowledge gaps due to knowledge expansion[^1] (e.g., 'what car does Bill Gates drive?')

> The process by which information can increase uncertainty: observing information induces patterns of activation that result in population of the Working Hypothesis Space (WHS). Entropy in this space results in uncertainty. When knowledge is poor, a trivia question fails to populate the WHS, so there is no entropy among working hypotheses. Partial knowledge allows one to consider competing hypotheses that motivate information-seeking for uncertainty reduction. Or something like that.


[^1]: We need to be more precise about what we mean by knowledge acquisition (or expansion, or accumulation). Can we express this in terms of graphs?
